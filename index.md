This site is currently under construction (like so many other places in Switzerland). More content to come soon.

Meanwhile, please look at my Talks page or read my thesis: [Generated Text as a Locus of Language Contact: Exploring the Impact of Generative AI on English and German](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/277983/1/Shaitarova_Anastassia_Dissertation.pdf) 

<!-- I earned my PhD in Computational Linguistics in a new, barely-defined research direction that is now rapidly gaining traction: **How does Generative AI affect the way we express ourselves**. Seeded in the pre-ChatGPT days, my research first focused on machine translation (MT) engines -- the biggest AI influncers of the time -- while only a small community of researchers was exposed to the output of large lange models (LLMs).   -->


<!-- investigating the new phenomenon 

am a computational linguist with a strong focus on multilingual NLP, language change, and AI-generated language. My work combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and linguistic theory to understand how technologies like ChatGPT and neural machine translation shape natural language use. I design behavioral experiments, conduct large-scale corpus analyses, and work hands-on with tools like Python, R, and open-source language models. My topics cover topics negation scope resolution, stylometry, and biomedical NLP.  -->
