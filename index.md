I earned my PhD in Computational Linguistics in a new, still barely-defined research direction that is now rapidly gaining traction: How does Generative AI affect the way we express ourselves linguistically. Started 

investigating the new phenomenon 

am a computational linguist with a strong focus on multilingual NLP, language change, and AI-generated language. My work combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and linguistic theory to understand how technologies like ChatGPT and neural machine translation shape natural language use. I design behavioral experiments, conduct large-scale corpus analyses, and work hands-on with tools like Python, R, and open-source language models. My topics cover topics negation scope resolution, stylometry, and biomedical NLP.
