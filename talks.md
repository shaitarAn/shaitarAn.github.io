        <strong>Can we Identify Machine-Generated Text? An Overview of Current Approaches</strong><br>
        <em>Invited Talk â€“ Expert Day, Data Innovation Alliance <br> Paulus Akademie, Zurich, Switzerland</em><br>
        I gave a talk on current detection strategies for AI-generated text. TL;DR was that we cannot reliably identify generated texts even with the current SOTA (gpt-3 at the time). Funnily, I dared to suggest  that the imminent release of GPT-4 could be a rumor (there was no official announcement but the community was anxiously buzzing about it). As I walked out of the venue, I learned that ChatGPT-4 was released an hour earlier.

        <strong>Negation Typology and General Representation Models for Cross-Lingual Zero-Shot Negation Scope Resolution in Russian, French, and Spanish</strong><br>
        <em>Conference Presentation â€“ NAACL Student Research Workshop</em> (Online)<br>
        This talk presented my paper exploring how multilingual representation models perform on negation scope tasks across typologically different languages. Unfortunately, the presentation had to be online since we were all suffering through the Covid-19 pandemic. A poster session at a major conference on Gather can be a lonely experience. But all the awkwardness of online conferencing aside, I managed to meet new people, listen to enlightening talks, and have many positive conversations about my paper on negations.
